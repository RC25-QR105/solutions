    "Coding activities are designed to get you practising in code while in class. They're generally graded for completion - code either runs or it doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you can't get something to work, honest attempts will recieve credit. So if you run into issues, add a markdown cell or add comments to your code so I can see what you tried and how you attempted to resolve the issue.\n",

    "### You must cite use of outside resources\n",
    "\n",
    "You must cite outside resources you used on any component of your assignment. For each problem or component you use an outside source, add a markdown cell and provide a description or direct link to the resource used. This includes working closely with fellow classmates, seeking the help of a tutor, or consulting generative AI resources. Note that work suspected to be directly copied from AI sources will receive zero credit, regardless of citation. You should never be copying and pasting code and calling it your own."

    "For this assignment you will be writing code for a \"Guess the Number\" game. The basic set up is to have the computer select a random value, then prompt the user to guess the integer value. The user will have a limited number of guesses. The game should output certain responses based on the guesss (i.e. if the guess is correct, too high or too low, or run out of guesses)\n",

    "* Talk through your code with your classmates, outline the logic you think you'll use before writing any code.\n",
    "* Write your code in pieces - meaning, write a small part, then test, then add to it and test again.\n",
    "* You can use any of the structures we've learned so far to get this to work - there are several ways to do this.\n",
    "* While chatgpt or other online sources will provide a solution to this problem, if you go right to copying those solutions you rob yourself of the opportunity to _learn_. Remember that honest attempts recieve most of the points on the assignment."
